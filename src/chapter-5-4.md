* Show empathy and understanding: Take the time to listen to your team members' concerns and needs, and show that you understand and value their perspective.
* Share credit and recognition: Acknowledge the contributions of your team members and share credit and recognition for successes.

Demonstrating Respect

Respect is another key element of successful relationships. To demonstrate respect as a leader, consider the following:
