Relational leadership is a people-focused approach to leadership that emphasizes building strong relationships and connections with team members. In this chapter, we'll explore how to assess your personal approach to leadership and identify areas where you can improve your relational leadership skills.

Self-Reflection
---------------

Self-reflection is an important first step in assessing your personal approach to leadership. To reflect on your leadership style:

* Consider your strengths and weaknesses: Think about the areas where you excel as a leader, as well as areas where you could improve.
* Identify your values: Consider the values that are important to you as a leader, such as transparency, respect, or collaboration.
* Reflect on past experiences: Think about situations where you felt you were successful as a leader, as well as situations where you struggled.

By reflecting on your personal approach to leadership, you can gain insight into your strengths and areas for improvement, and identify opportunities to adopt a more relational leadership style.

Seeking Feedback

Seeking feedback from others is another valuable way to assess your personal approach to leadership. To solicit feedback:

* Ask for input: Ask team members for their honest feedback on your leadership style and how you can improve.
* Listen actively: Be open and receptive to feedback, and avoid becoming defensive or dismissive.
* Follow up: Take action on feedback by implementing changes and following up with team members to ensure that improvements have been made.

By seeking feedback from others, you can gain perspective on how your leadership style is perceived by those around you, and make adjustments to become a more effective relational leader.

Identifying Areas for Improvement
---------------------------------

Once you've reflected on your personal approach to leadership and sought feedback from others, it's important to identify specific areas where you can improve your relational leadership skills. Some areas for improvement may include:

* Listening more actively and demonstrating empathy towards team members
* Fostering open communication and creating a safe space for feedback and discussion
* Providing more opportunities for team members to take ownership of their work and contribute their unique perspectives and ideas
* Building trust and respect through transparency, honesty, and follow-through on commitments

By identifying specific areas for improvement, you can take concrete steps towards becoming a more effective relational leader.

Conclusion

Assessing your personal approach to leadership is an important step in becoming a more effective relational leader. By reflecting on your strengths and weaknesses, seeking feedback from others, and identifying areas for improvement, you can adopt a more people-focused approach to leadership that fosters trust, respect, and collaboration among your team members.
